# JosephusProblem
In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus Problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem. Following is the problem statement:
There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
The program reads the numbers N and K and then N numbers which are the elements (people) in the circle. K is the number of elements (people) skipped in each step.
The program prints the steps of removing elements (people) from the circle until there are only 2 elements left.
